productivityscripts
===================
This directory contains the various tools that I have written to make my workflow life easier.


**/taskharvester**
	This python script will scrape my Day One journal (and eventually evernote) for any tasks.
	It will create an output file of all lines that start with an @ (and aren't @done) - my
	nomenclature for a task that needs to be done.  I can then add these tasks to my todo list.
	
**/SaveToJournalButton**
     	This page shows how to develop a bookmarklet that can be used while reading web pages.  Simply highlight any text you'd like quoted, and press the journal button.  If DayOne is installed, a new entry will be created, along with a link to the page.  Basically stolen from: http://somerandomnerd.net/blog/2013/7/12/a-day-one-bookmarklet-for-ios
