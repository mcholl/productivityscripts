productivityscripts
===================
This directory contains the various tools that I have written to make my workflow life easier.


**/taskharvester**
	This python script will scrape my Day One journal (and eventually evernote) for any tasks.
	It will create an output file of all lines that start with an @ (and aren't @done) - my
	nomenclature for a task that needs to be done.  I can then add these tasks to my todo list.
